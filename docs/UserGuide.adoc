== Introduction

Deadline Manager (DLM) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for keeping track of tasks*. More importantly, DLM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DLM can help you sort out your upcoming tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

The steps to quickly get started with the project are as follows -

.  Install Java version `9` or later on your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your deadline manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`n/v1.1 milestone d/2/10/2018 t/CS2103T p/1` : adds a task named `v1.1 milestone` to the deadline manager.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Assignment 2`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Assignment 2 t/CS3230` or as `n/Assignment 2`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/CS2103`, `t/CS2103 t/Project` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DEADLINE`, `d/DEADLINE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Help will list the available functions for the user to use.

Format: `help`

=== Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to the deadline manager +
Format: `add n/NAME d/DEADLINE [P/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0)

****
* `DEADLINE` should be a date in the format DD/MM/YYYY. Examples of valid dates are: 29/03/2018, 29/3/2018, 1/1/2018.
* `PRIORITY` should only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The lower the number, the higher the priority of the task. (1 = Highest Priority, 4 = Lowest Priority)
****

[TIP]
You can have two tasks with the same attributes!

Examples:

* `add n/Assignment 2 d/1/1/2018 p/1` +
Adds a task with name `Assignment 2` with a deadline on 1st January 2018 with priority 1 (highest priority).
* `add n/v1.1 milestone d/9/10/2018 t/CS2103T t/Project p/2` +
Adds a task with name `v1.1 milestone` with a deadline on 9th October 2018 with priority 2 (second highest priority). It is additionally tagged with 2 tags: `CS2103T` and `Project`.

//TODO: Kien
=== Add a recurring task : `addr`
Adds a recurring task to the deadline manager. +
Format: `addr n/NAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY f/FREQUENCY [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0)

****
* `DEADLINE` should be the first time that this task should trigger. It should be a date in the format DD/MM/YYYY. Examples of valid dates are: 29/03/2018, 29/3/2018, 1/1/2018.
* `FREQUENCY` (in number of days), should be how frequently the task should recur.
* `PRIORITY` should only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The lower the number, the higher the priority of the task. (1 = Highest Priority, 4 = Lowest Priority)
****

Examples:

* `add n/CS2103T Tutorials d/8/9/2018 p/3 f/7 t/CS2103T` +
Adds a recurring task named `CS2103T Tutorials` with the first occurrence in 8th September 2018 and repeats every 7 days. The task is also labelled with priority 3 (second lowest) and tagged with `CS2103T`.

=== Listing all tasks : `list`

Shows a list of all tasks in the deadline manager. +
Format: `list`

=== Editing a task : `edit`
Edits an existing task in the deadline manager. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the task will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the task's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* The range of possible values for each argument of the edit command follows that of the add command.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 d/3/10/2018` +
Edits the deadline of the 1st task to 3rd October 2018.
* `edit 2 n/v1.2 Milestone t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd task to be `v1.2 Milestone` and clears all existing tags.
* `edit 1 p/1` +
Edits the priority of the 1st task to 1 (highest priority).

=== Locating tasks by name: `find`
//TODO: Bernard to update?
Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `find Assignment` +
Returns `assignment` and `Assignment 3`
* `find CS2103T Assignment 3` +
Returns any task having names `CS2103T`, `assignment`, or `3`

=== Filtering a list of tasks: `filter`
Filters the current list of tasks with a specified filter expression. +
Format: `filter FILTER_EXPRESSION`

When this command is used, Deadline Manager will display only those tasks which satisfies the given filter expression. +
Filter predicates are the core of the `filter` command.  Each filter predicate specifies a particular attribute (e.g. deadline, priority) and a value to test this attribute against (e.g. deadline being earlier than 1/10/2018).  Filter predicates are regarded as "indivisible". +
// TODO: What does it mean by indivisible ?
Filter expressions are composed from some number of filter predicates, and the `filter` command is designed to accept arbitrarily complex filter expressions that can be composed from any number of filter predicates. +
The format for `FILTER_EXPRESSION` is defined recursively in the following paragraphs.

`FILTER_EXPRESSION` is a string in the following format:

* `FILTER_PREDICATE` -- This filter expression contains a single filter predicate
* `FILTER_EXPRESSION & FILTER_EXPRESSION` -- This filter expression is a logical conjunction (i.e. AND) of two other filter expressions.  The operator `&` may be substituted with `&&`.
* `FILTER_EXPRESSION | FILTER_EXPRESSION` -- This filter expression is a logical disjunction (i.e. OR) of two other filter expressions.  The operator `|` may be substituted with `||`.
* `! FILTER_EXPRESSION` -- This filter expression is a logical negation (i.e. NOT) of two other filter expressions.
* `( FILTER_EXPRESSION )` -- This filter expression is surrounded by parentheses.

****

Parentheses are used for finer control the order that filter expressions are combined.  By default, `!` has highest precedence (i.e. `!` is applied first), followed by `&`, then followed by `|`.

When it is unambiguous, whitespace between the operators and filter expressions may be omitted.

****

`FILTER_PREDICATE` is a string in the following format-: `<key><operator><phrase>`:

* where `key` is an alphanumeric string that describes the attribute being compared. Example - `priority`, `tag` and `name`
* where `operator` is one of `:`, `=`, `<`, `>`
* where `phrase` is a string that describes what to search (this is called the search phrase)

The operator `:` is known as the *convenience* operator -- it is an alias for the operator that intuitively does what you expect for the given `key`.  More details are given below.

The `<` and `>` operators are non-strict: Every task that will be shown using `=` will also be shown using `<` or `>`.

In general, both `key` and `phrase` do not need to be placed in quotes.  However, if whitespace or special chracters (i.e. those that have a meaning for compositing filter expressions) are part of `phrase`, then `phrase` must be in quotes (either single or double quotes will work, but the opening and closing quotes must be of the same type).

****

Meaning of the operators for each valid key:

* When `key` is `n` or `name`, the task name is compared.  Comparision is case-insensitive.  The operator `>` tests if the search phrase is contained within the task name.  The operator `<` tests if the task name is contained within the search phrase.  The operator `=` tests if the search phrase is exactly the same as the task name.  The convenience operator is an alias for `>`.
* When `key` is `d` or `due`, the task's due date is compared, and the search phrase is interpreted as a date.  Dates must be in `d/m/y` format.  The operator `>` tests if the task's due date is on or after the specified due date.  The operator `<` tests if the task's due date is on or before the specified due date.  The operator `=` tests if the task's due date is exactly equal to the specified due date.  The convenience operator is an alias for `<`.
* When `key` is `p` or `priority`, the task's priority is compared, and the search phrase is interpreted as an integer, representing the priority to be searched.  A priority of zero matches all the tasks with no priority set.  The operator `>` tests if the task has priority at most as high as the specified priority.  The operator `<` tests if the task has priority at least as high as the specified priority.  The operator `=` tests if the task's priority is exactly equal to the specified priority.  The convenience operator is an alias for `<`.  Note that priority 1 is the highest priority, and priority 4 is the lowest priority.
* When `key` is `t` or `tag`, the task's tags are compared, and the search phrase is interpreted as a (unordered) set of tags.  Multiple tags are separated by commas (see examples below).  The operator `>` tests if every tag of the given task is contained in the specified set of tags.  The operator `<` tests if the every specified tag is present for the given task.  The operator `=` tests if the set of tags for the given task is exactly the same as the set of specified tags.  The convenience operator is an alias for `<`.
* Any other `key` will cause Deadline Manager to produce an error.

****

Examples:

* `filter due<1/10/2018`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have deadlines on or before 1st October 2018.
// TODO: define a subset in glossary

* `filter d=1/10/2018`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have deadlines equal to 1st October 2018.

* `filter d:1/10/2018`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have deadlines on or before 1st October 2018.

* `filter name:Alex`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have a name that contains "Alex".

* `filter name:"Alex Tan"`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have a name that contains "Alex Tan".

* `filter p=1`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have priority = 1 (highest priority).

* `filter p<3`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that have priority < 3. (Highest priority or second highest priority.)

* `filter t:CS2103T`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that has the tag "CS2103T".

* `filter t:CS2103T,CS2101`
Returns a subset of the current list of tasks that has both the tags "CS2103T" and "CS2101".

=== Filtering a list of tasks: `search`

Filters the current list of tasks with a specified filter predicate.

This is an alias for `filter`.  They perform exactly the same function.  The alias is provided because it is sometimes more intuitive to think of certain filter operations as 'search' operations, e.g. searching for a task that has a particular name.

//TODO: Sidhant
=== Sorting a list of tasks : `sort`

Sorts the lists of all the tasks which the user is currently viewing. Generally meant to be used in combination with `filter`. +

When this command is used, Deadline Manager will sort all the currently displayed tasks according to the user specified comparison method. +
Sort comparators are the core of the `sort` command.  Each sort comparator specifies a particular attribute (Example - `name`, `priority`) and a comparison direction, i.e ascending or descending.

The entire sorting command is composed of a chain of sort comparators. This chain helps the user to define which tasks to show earlier and which ones to show latter. +

****

What this means is that in case two tasks are in tie according to the first comparator, then the decision to place which task first is determined by the next comparator, and so on.

****

Format: `sort SORT_COMPARATOR [SORT_COMPARATORS]...` +
****
* Format of `SORT_COMPARATOR`: `(n|name|d|due|p|priority)(<|>)` OR `(t|tag)(<|>){TAG1 TAG2 TAG3 ...}`
* Sorts the list by the 1st comparator, in case of ties, it sorts by 2nd comparator and so on.
* Meaning of the operators for each valid key:
** When `key` is `n` or `name`, the task name is compared. Comparision is case-insensitive.
** When `key` is `d` or `due`, the task's due date is compared.
** When `key` is `p` or `priority`, the task's priority is compared. Note that 1 is the highest priority and 4 is the lowest priority.
** When `key` is `t` or `tag`, the task's tags are compared.
[NOTE]
For sorting by tags the user has to specify which tags are more important and which are less important.
** Any other `key` will cause Deadline Manager to produce an error.
* < stands for sorting in ascending order and > stands for sorting in descending order
****
Examples:

* `sort n>` +
Sorts the current list of tasks in view in descending order by name, where sorting is done in alphabetical order.
* `sort due< name>` +
Sorts the current list of tasks in view in ascending order by due date, where ties are broken by descending order of names.
* `sort priority<` +
Sorts the current list of tasks in view in ascending order by priority.
* `sort tag<{cs2100 family cs2103t}` +
Sorts the current list of tasks in view in ascending order by tags. In this case all the tasks with the tag `cs2100` will be placed
before those tasks with the tag `family`, finally followed by those tasks with the tag `cs2103t`.

****
* In case a task does not belong to any of the tags mentioned it will be placed at the bottom of the sorted list.
* In case a task contains more than one tag specified in the comparator, then it will be attempted to be sorted according to those tags first which place it former in the sorted list.
****

//TODO: Sidhant
//Not sure if this is implemented
===  Resolve tasks : `resolve` (coming in v2.0)
Deletes a specified task from the deadline manager. The index refers to the entries of a previous call to list or search. +
Format: `resolve INDEX`

****
* Deletes the task at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
****

Examples:

* `resolve 1` +
The 1st task displayed by the deadline manager will be deleted.


//TODO: Sidhant
=== Snooze tasks : `snooze` (coming in v2.0)
Hides a specified task from the deadline manager until the time specified in the parameter has elapsed. The index refers to the entries of a previous call to list or search. +
Format: `snooze INDEX d/DEADLINE`

****
* Modifies the contents of the task at the specified by INDEX to a new date `DEADLINE`. The index referes to the index number shown in the displayed task list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
****

Examples:

* `snooze 1 d/20/09/2018` +
A task is 'snoozed' as its deadline is now shifted backwards to 20th September 2018.



//TODO: Ranald
=== Manage attachments of a task : `attachment`
Allows the user to add, list, delete and retrieve files associated with a specific task. +
Deadline manager does not make a copy or backup the files added. Only the location of the files are stored and it can be modified, renamed, moved or deleted without Deadline manager's knowledge. As such, there is no guarantee for a file associated with a specific task to always exist. +
Format: `INDEX COMMAND [p/FILEPATH] [n/FILENAME]`

****
*  Modify and manages the attachments of the task at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* `COMMAND` is either `add`, `list`, `delete` or `get` +
* For `add` commands, `FILEPATH` argument is required to denote the file you intend to attach to the task. A file must exist at the `FILEPATH` specified.
* For `list` commands, no additional arguments are required.
* For `delete` commands, `FILENAME` argument is required to represent the file to delete.
* For `get` commands, `FILENAME` argument is required to represent the file to retrieve, `FILEPATH` argument is required to denote the destination you want the file to be exported to. If there is an existing file at `FILEPATH`, it would be overwritten without warning.
****

[TIP]
The application does not allow adding more than one file with the same filename to the same task, even if they are in different locations on the computer.

Examples:

* Add: `attachment 1 add p/C:\Documents\HelloWorld.docx` +
Adds an attachment located at "C:\Documents\HelloWorld.docx" to the 1st task in the deadline manager.
* Get: `attachment 2 get p/C:\Documents\TaskAttachments.zip n/Assignment.zip` +
Saves an attachment named "Assignment.zip" of the 2nd task in the deadline manager to "C:\Documents\TaskAttachments.zip"
* List: `attachment 1 list` +
Lists all attachments currently associated with the 1st task in the deadline manager.
* Delete: `attachment 1 delete n/HelloWorld.docx`
Removes the association of the attachment named "HelloWorld.docx" with the 1st task in the deadline manager.

[NOTE]
The `import`, `export` commands described below do *NOT* support backing up attachments. However they will keep a link to the attachments path if any.


//TODO: Si Jie
=== Importing a set of tasks: `import`
Import tasks that were previous generated by an export command, from the filename given as parameter.  +
